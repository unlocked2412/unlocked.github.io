One definition of the noun “example” is “a typical instance,” according to the **Oxford English Dictionary** (OED). And one definition of the noun “instance” is “an example”.

## History
The phrase “for example” was first recorded in 1584, and “for instance” in 1657, according to published references in the dictionary.

## Definitions
The OED doesn’t specifically define the phrase “for example, but it says “for instance” means “for example, as an instance of what has been said.”

## Digression

Technically:

I would hear **for example** to refer to a particular type of occurrence where many types exist.

And I would hear **for instance** to refer to a particular occurrence of the same type, where many occurrences exist.

**Examples**:

> The auditors look for many types of fraudulent activity, for example, reporting revenue from fictional sales. Implying there are other types of fraudulent activities.

> Mr X is being investigated for wash sale rules violations, for instance the trade with ABC Corp where he bought the same shares in his personal account from DEF Corp. Implying there are other violations of the same type, ie wash sale violations, and this is just one instance/occurance.

In principle, they are not synonymous. However, in practice they are used _interchangeably_.

There are also some specialized English corpora, such as American English, British English, and English Fiction.

	In the field of computational linguistics, an n-gram (sometimes also called Q-gram) is a contiguous sequence of **n** items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.
